[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/Tw1ddle/Rectangle-Bin-Packing-Demo.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/Tw1ddle/Rectangle-Bin-Packing-Demo)

Demo of the Haxe rectangle [bin packing](https://github.com/Tw1ddle/Rectangle-Bin-Packing) algorithms [haxelib](http://lib.haxe.org/p/bin-packing). Try the demo [in your browser](http://samcodes.itch.io/rectangle-bin-packer).

### Usage ###

This demo requires HaxeFlixel and the bin-packing haxelib, so install these first:

```bash
haxelib install flixel
haxelib install bin-packing
```

Repeatedly tap the buttons at the bottom of the screen to test the packing algorithms. Rectangles are numbered as they are added, flipped rectangles are marked with the letter "F". Tap the test button to run sets of tests.
