# Rectangle Bin Packing Demo

Demo of the Haxe rectangle [bin packing](https://github.com/Tw1ddle/Rectangle-Bin-Packing) algorithms [haxelib](http://lib.haxe.org/p/bin-packing). Try the demo [in your browser](http://samcodes.itch.io/rectangle-bin-packer).

### Usage ###

This demo requires HaxeFlixel and the bin-packing haxelib, so install these first:

```bash
haxelib git flixel https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel dev # Else try stable branch of HaxeFlixel: haxelib install flixel
haxelib install bin-packing
```

Build the app and repeatedly tap the buttons at the bottom of the screen to test the packing algorithms. Rectangles are numbered as they are added, and flipped rectangles are marked with an "F". Tap the test button to run sets of tests.
